Each line in the input consists of zero or more declarations separated by a comma.

A declaration is either

* a single node declaration:    n
                                where n is an int

* an edge declaration:          n -> m
                                where n,m are ints (declaring a directed edge
                                from node n to node m)


or extended versions of one of the above:

* a node range declaration:     n .. m
                                where n,m are ints (declaring nodes n, n+1,
                                n+2, ..., m-1, m)

* a path declaration:           n1 -> n2 -> ... -> nr
                                where ni are ints (declaring edges n1 -> n2,
                                n2 -> n3, ..., n(r-1) -> nr)
